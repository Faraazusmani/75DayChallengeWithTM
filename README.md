# 75DaysChallengeWithTM

The plan is to solve 3 to 4 questions on a daily basis provided by TechMaestro.
The questions are available on Leetcode and will cover all the levels of difficulty ranging from easy to medium and hard.
This repository contains solutions to the same above mentioned problems.
My language of prefernce is Python 3 so the solutions will be in Python 3 only.

This repository will help me stay motivated and also allow me to keep track of my daily progress. I aim at learning a lot of data structures and algorithms through this challenge that will help me get better at programming.
